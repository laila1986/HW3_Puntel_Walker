## Prompt

![](images/DC_Versus_Marvel_1.jpg)


- Is there any pattern around gender in the characters of comics?


It shows that overall both companies have approxmately the same proportion of male characters, Marvel having <5% more, while DC has approximately 5% greater proportion of female characters total than Marvel does. Both companies have roughly twice as many male characters as female characters.


- Is there any change over time?
- Does the company (DC vs. Marvel) have and effect?
- What can you say about "good characters" vs. "villains" in regards to their characteristics, gender, the company, over time?


##Data processing
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

marvel<-read.csv("marvel-wikia-data.csv") #Read Marvel data
dc<-read.csv("dc-wikia-data.csv") #Read DC data
colnames(marvel)[13]<-"YEAR" # Matching YEAR column 
dc$publisher<-"DC" #Add publisher
marvel$publisher<-"Marvel" #Add publisher
master<-rbind(dc, marvel) # combine data


#Summary of the data 

res1<-master %>%
  group_by(publisher, SEX) %>%
  summarise(Count= length(SEX))
  

```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(res1)
```

From the table above we can see that prior to any deeper analysis that female characters seem to be lower than male in both companies, both companies have roughly 2 times as many male characters as female characters.
 

fem <- length(which(combined$SEX == "Female Characters"))
count_female
count_male <- length(which(combined$SEX == "Male Characters"))
count_male


csex<- count(master, c("publisher","YEAR", "SEX"))


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(csex, aes(x=YEAR, y= freq, fill=SEX))+ geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")+ facet_wrap(~publisher) +ylim(0,350)+
       labs(x="Year", y="Frequency") + facet_wrap(~ publisher)+
       theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=18,vjust=-0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=18,angle=90, vjust=1.2),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        legend.text =element_text(size=10),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))

```




#Appearances vs time for Maverl and DC

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(master, aes(x=YEAR, y=APPEARANCES, fill=SEX))+ geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")+
       labs(x="Year", y="Appearances") + facet_wrap(~ publisher)+
       theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=18,vjust=-0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=18,angle=90, vjust=1.2),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        legend.text =element_text(size=10),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))

```

According to this figure, Dc company had more intensive appearence of male characters before 1950, after that year it seems like different type of "SEX" characters started to appear.Besides, early on there were more male characters than female but according to this data after the 90' female character showed to be higher of similar in number of appareces than male. 
For the Marvel company, female characters had more appareces in ealies 50' however after that period of time, male characters started to appear more. Also, the diversity in Sex seem to be higher for this company than DC. 




Independly characters's sex, for both companies quantity of appearences decreased over time
