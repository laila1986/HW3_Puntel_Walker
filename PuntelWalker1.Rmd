## Prompt

![](images/DC_Versus_Marvel_1.jpg)

You are going to look into the raw data behind the story [Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/). 

The data come from [Marvel Wikia](http://marvel.wikia.com/Main_Page) and [DC Wikia](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page). Characters were scraped on August 24. Appearance counts were scraped on September 2. The month and year of the first issue each character appeared in was pulled on October 6.



- Is there any pattern around gender in the characters of comics?
- Is there any change over time?
- Does the company (DC vs. Marvel) have and effect?
- What can you say about "good characters" vs. "villains" in regards to their characteristics, gender, the company, over time?

```{r}
#load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library (dplyr)

```

## Read in data

The first step is to read in the Marvel and DC data and combine into a single data frame. Code is run with the working directory as the project (HW3) base folder.

```{r}
marvel<-read.csv("data/marvel-wikia-data.csv") #Read Marvel data
dc<-read.csv("data/dc-wikia-data.csv") #Read DC data
colnames(marvel)[13]<-"YEAR" #Change last column to YEAR in Marvel to match YEAR in DC
dc$publisher<-"DC" #Add publisher
marvel$publisher<-"Marvel" #Add publisher 
master<-rbind(dc, marvel) #Combine both tables into one data frame
```

##Summary of the data by Gender 

From the table below we can see that prior to any deep analysis that female characters seem to be lower than male in both companies. Each of the companies have roughly 2 times as many male characters as female characters.

```{r}
res1<-master %>%
  group_by(publisher, SEX) %>%
  summarise(Count= length(SEX))
```  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(res1)
```

We created this subset of data to look at differences between Female and Male genders.

```{r}
sub_master<-subset(master, SEX %in% c("Female Characters", "Male Characters")) 
```


#Female vs Male characters over time

According to these figures, Dc company had more intensive appearence of male characters before 1950, after that year it seems like different types of "SEX" started to appear.Besides, early on there were more male characters than female but according to this data after the 90' female characters showed to be higher or similar in number of appareces than male.For the Marvel company, female characters had more appareces in ealies 50' however after that period of time, male characters started to appear more. Also, the diversity in Sex seemed to be higher for Marvel company than DC. Independly of the company, characters's sex quantities of appearences decreased over time. Interestingly, the number of female characters over time in both DC and Marvel has almost doubled after 1950.
 

```{r}
#csex<- count(master, c("publisher","YEAR", "SEX")) ##Using this line of code it worked at some point but after loading dplyr doenst work anymore.Next lines of code seem to do a better job. 

```
```{r}
csex<- master %>% 
  group_by(publisher, YEAR, SEX) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(SEX))

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(csex, aes(x=YEAR, y= freq, fill=SEX))+ geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")+ facet_wrap(~publisher) +ylim(0,350)+
       labs(x="Year", y="Frequency") + facet_wrap(~ publisher)+
       theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=18,vjust=-0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=18,angle=90, vjust=1.2),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        legend.text =element_text(size=10),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))

```




```{r}
sub_csex<- sub_master %>% 
  group_by(publisher, YEAR, SEX) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(SEX))

```


Looking only at Female and Male gender

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(sub_csex, aes(x=YEAR, y= freq, fill=SEX))+ geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")+ facet_wrap(~publisher) +ylim(0,350)+
       labs(x="Year", y="Frequency") + facet_wrap(~ publisher)+
       theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=18,vjust=-0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=18,angle=90, vjust=1.2),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        legend.text =element_text(size=10),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))

```


##Appearances vs time for Maverl and DC

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(sub_master, aes(x=YEAR, y=APPEARANCES, fill=SEX))+ geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")+
       labs(x="Year", y="Appearances") + facet_wrap(~ publisher)+
       theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=18,vjust=-0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=18,angle=90, vjust=1.2),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size=12),
        legend.text =element_text(size=10),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))

```



##How is the align related with the gender? 

According to the data Females present 43% and 27% of Good and bad characters, respectively. On the other hand, Males showed exactly the opposite trents having more frequency of bad characters. Looking at the frequency of female and males within align and years, we can see that differences in align were notorious after 1960. Apparently, good characters tended to increse over time but overall bad male characters were predominant.    

```{r}
res2<-sub_master %>%
  group_by(SEX, ALIGN) %>%
  summarise(Count= length(SEX))
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(res2)
```



```{r}
calign<- sub_master %>% 
  group_by(YEAR, SEX, ALIGN) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(SEX))
```

```{r}
ggplot(calign, aes(x=YEAR, y=freq)) + geom_line(aes(color=SEX)) + labs(y= "Frequency", x= "Year")+ facet_wrap(~ALIGN)
```

## Are gender and appearences related?

One pattern around gender that could be interesting is how frequently different genders appear. As the characters have been released for varying amounts of time the number of appearances will be normalized by how long they've been in the comics. The current year (2016) will be used to calculate years since a character's first appearance.

```{r}
norm<-master$APPEARANCES/(2016-master$YEAR)

sc<-qplot(master$SEX[master$SEX!=""], norm[master$SEX!=""], color=master$SEX[master$SEX!=""],
      xlab="Gender", ylab="Normalized Appearances")
sc + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), legend.title=element_blank())
```

When normalized to the date of their first appearances, male characters appear most in the comics. This index highlights predominant characters as outliers. The majority of characters appear infrequently, regardless of gender. These are likely characters who serve a minor role in only a few (or a single) comic.

## Secret vs. Public Identities

Do heroes and villains differ in how many have kept their identity secret? 

```{r}
align<-master$ALIGN[master$ALIGN=="Good Characters"&master$ID!=""|master$ALIGN=="Bad Characters"&master$ID!=""]
id<-master$ID[master$ALIGN=="Good Characters"&master$ID!=""|master$ALIGN=="Bad Characters"&master$ID!=""]
             
sp<-ggplot(data=NULL, aes(x=align, fill=id)) +
    geom_bar(stat="count", position=position_dodge()) +
    xlab("Alignment") + ylab("Number of Characters")
sp + theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

Bad characters are twice as likely to have a secret identity than a public identity. In contrast, good characters are slightly more likely to have a public identity than a secret one.
